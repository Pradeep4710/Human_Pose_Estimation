# Human Pose Estimation using Machine Learning

This project implements a real-time human pose estimation system using machine learning techniques. The system detects and visualizes human body keypoints (like shoulders, elbows, knees, etc.) in real-time from video input, utilizing deep learning models like OpenPose or MediaPipe, OpenCV for video processing, and Streamlit for the user interface.

## Features
- Real-time human pose detection from video input.
- Displays key body points and their connections.
- User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
- Built with Python and popular libraries like OpenCV, MediaPipe, and TensorFlow/PyTorch.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Version 3.6+)
- **OpenCV**: For image and video processing.
- **MediaPipe / OpenPose**: For real-time pose estimation using deep learning models.
- **Streamlit**: For building an interactive user interface.
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch**: For running deep learning models.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed on your system. It is also recommended to use a virtual environment for this project.

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pradeep4710/Human_Pose_Estimation
cd Human_Pose_Estimation
```

### 2. Install dependencies
You can install the required dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Running the Application
To run the project, use the following command to launch the Streamlit interface:
```bash
streamlit run estimation_app.py
```
This will open the application in your web browser, where you can interact with the system and view real-time pose estimations.

## Requirements
The following libraries are required:
- `opencv-python`
- `mediapipe`
- `streamlit`
- `tensorflow` or `torch` (depending on which framework you use for the model)
- `numpy`
- `pandas`

You can find the full list in the `requirements.txt` file.

## How It Works
1. The system uses OpenCV to capture video input from the camera or a video file.
2. The captured video frames are processed by MediaPipe or OpenPose, which detect key body points (e.g., shoulders, elbows, hips).
3. The system overlays these keypoints on the video, providing real-time feedback.
4. Streamlit is used to create an interactive interface where users can view the pose detection output and control various settings.

## Future Improvements
- Extend the system to handle **multi-person pose estimation**.
- Improve accuracy under **occlusions** (when parts of the body are hidden).
- Add **3D pose estimation** to understand depth and enhance the system for VR/AR.
- Optimize the system for **mobile platforms**.
